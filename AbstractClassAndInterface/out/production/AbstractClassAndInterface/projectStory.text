Explanation

Abstract Class (PaymentProcessor): Provides a template method (processPayment) that outlines the steps for processing a payment.
Subclasses (CreditCardProcessor) implement the specifics of each step.
Interface (PaymentGateway): Defines the contract for connecting to and processing payments through a payment gateway.
Implementations (PayPalGateway, StripeGateway) provide the actual code to interact with different payment services.
Service Class (PaymentService): Uses both the abstract class and interface to process payments,
demonstrating how different implementations can be swapped easily.
This design allows for flexibility and extensibility in adding new payment methods or gateways.
This example demonstrates how abstract classes and interfaces can be used together to build a flexible and extensible payment processing system.
